# Activity
![Activity 1 (4)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1e408f6-0cd5-4e39-9224-9460cfeeca44)
* Overall, users still reached the recommendation weekly 150 minutes of activity. It can be seen that activity increased on weekends, particularly on Saturday, across all activity levels.
* Fairly active and very active minutes fluctuate but remain relatively low, showing room for more intense activity, especially mid-week.
* Lightly active minutes dominate consistently, indicating that most of the activity is low-intensity.
* Thursday is the least active day overall, particularly in the lightly active and fairly active categories.

There is a direct relationship between the intensity of the activity and the amount of calories burnedâ€”the more vigorous the activity, the higher the calorie burn.
![Number of users track data over the period](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/705c5997-5212-4684-bdab-11788d01e8d3)
It can be seen that, the number of users tracking data decrease over the period. Only 21 of 33 users completed tracking the data at the end of period.
# Step
![Average Step over period](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90739cfd-f6ae-45d9-a5e8-e9db20c12edc)
In general, the average daily step count fluctuates significantly, with some distinct peaks and troughs but most of time users still reached minimum 7000 steps per day. There is a downward trend in the number of steps over time, particularly a sharp decline towards the end of the period.
![Average Step per Day](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0931efc-0004-459d-b722-3cf0736772c7)
The chart indicates a fairly active lifestyle overall, with consistent activity during the weekdays and slightly increased activity on Tuesday and Saturday.  The lower step count on Sunday suggests a possible rest day.
![Average Step per Hour](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21d637b3-b949-4882-8c0b-8add7d1cf255)
* The chart shows a clear pattern of activity, with very few steps taken during the night and early morning, and a significant increase in steps starting around 7:00 AM.
* The most active periods are late morning (around 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM) and late afternoon (around 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM).
* Activity gradually declines from the late afternoon peak until late evening

* There is a positive correlation between the average step total and the average calories burned. This means that as the number of steps increases, the number of calories burned also tends to increase.
* The gray line on the chart represents the line of best fit, which shows the general trend in the data.
* While there's a clear upward trend, there is also some variability in the data. This means that for a given number of steps, the number of calories burned can vary from person to person.
# Sleep
![Average Hour Sleep by Day](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/702a2012-9e39-4081-b390-700eea99e617)
* The average sleep duration seems to be fairly consistent throughout the week, hovering around 7 hours.
* Sunday boasts the longest sleep duration, while Tuesday shows the shortest.

* Steps and Sleep: There isn't strong evidence for a direct relationship between how many steps someone takes and how long they sleep. Other factors likely play a bigger role.
* Steps and Awake Time: There's a possible link between more time awake and fewer steps, but this needs more data to confirm. It could be that longer awake hours are due to sedentary work, not more activity.
* Individual Variation is High: People's bodies and routines differ greatly, which the scatter plot reflects. What's "normal" for steps and sleep varies hugely.

Sleep duration varies throughout the month, averaging around 7 hours per night. However, the data is incomplete as users didn't consistently track their sleep every night.
  
![Average Time Awake by Day](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/091c2bbd-46ff-4abb-8455-c274c979fc8e)
With the exception of the unusual value for Sunday, the chart suggests a relatively consistent awake time throughout the week, likely influenced by work or school schedules. 
# Weight
![User ID Log of Weight Over Time](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/410cc0f5-2fdf-4ddf-bafb-44254529bc82)
It looks like some people prefer to check their weight periodically rather than every day.  We see this because 4 users logged their weight only a few times (between 2 and 5 times) over the whole month.
# User Log

People are much more consistent with tracking their activity compared to sleep or weight.  Weight tracking is the least popular, suggesting a stronger interest in activity monitoring.
