# Activity
![Activity 1 (4)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1e408f6-0cd5-4e39-9224-9460cfeeca44)
* Overall, users still reached the recommendation weekly 150 minutes of activity. It can be seen that activity increased on weekends, particularly on Saturday, across all activity levels.
* Fairly active and very active minutes fluctuate but remain relatively low, showing room for more intense activity, especially mid-week.
* Lightly active minutes dominate consistently, indicating that most of the activity is low-intensity.
* Thursday is the least active day overall, particularly in the lightly active and fairly active categories.

There is a direct relationship between the intensity of the activity and the amount of calories burnedâ€”the more vigorous the activity, the higher the calorie burn.
![Number of users track data over the period](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/705c5997-5212-4684-bdab-11788d01e8d3)
It can be seen that, the number of users tracking data decrease over the period. Only 21 of 33 users completed tracking the data at the end of period.
# Step
![Average Step over period](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90739cfd-f6ae-45d9-a5e8-e9db20c12edc)
In general, the average daily step count fluctuates significantly, with some distinct peaks and troughs but most of time users still reached minimum 7000 steps per day. There is a downward trend in the number of steps over time, particularly a sharp decline towards the end of the period.

The chart indicates a fairly active lifestyle overall, with consistent activity during the weekdays and slightly increased activity on Tuesday and Saturday.  The lower step count on Sunday suggests a possible rest day.

* The chart shows a clear pattern of activity, with very few steps taken during the night and early morning, and a significant increase in steps starting around 7:00 AM.
* The most active periods are late morning (around 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM) and late afternoon (around 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM).
* Activity gradually declines from the late afternoon peak until late evening

* There is a positive correlation between the average step total and the average calories burned. This means that as the number of steps increases, the number of calories burned also tends to increase.
* The gray line on the chart represents the line of best fit, which shows the general trend in the data.
* While there's a clear upward trend, there is also some variability in the data. This means that for a given number of steps, the number of calories burned can vary from person to person.
