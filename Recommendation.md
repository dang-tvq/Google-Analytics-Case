# 1. Promote Features Bellabeat Shares with Fitbit: 
* Highlight the existing features that Fitbit users already rely on, such as physical activity tracking, and expand these by offering specific exercise tracking and personalized workout plans through coaching memberships.

* Since users are already meeting the recommended moderate-to-vigorous activity levels, they will likely appreciate tools to monitor daily performance and set new goals with the Bellabeat app. The coaching membership can help them maintain their active minutes or push themselves further.

* Additionally, the CDC recommends incorporating resistance training, which could be easily integrated and monitored through Bellabeat’s coaching features. Most users engage primarily in light-intensity activities; Bellabeat could enhance this experience by allowing them to track specific exercises like yoga or walking, encouraging more tailored daily activity.

# 2. Promote Holistic Wellness Based on Fitbit Data: 
* Leverage Fitbit user data to identify areas for improvement, like sleep health, and position Bellabeat as a solution. Promote the sleep tracker feature, which helps users meet the recommended 7 hours of sleep and monitor sleep cycles for better rest.

* Users can utilize the stress meter to assess how their sleep and physical activity may affect their mental well-being. For users aiming to increase their physical activity, setting step count goals of more than 7,000 steps can help reduce mortality risks, and Bellabeat’s inactivity alarm can encourage them to stay active throughout the day.

* The coaching membership is also an excellent tool to break the midweek activity plateau seen in Fitbit data, providing accountability and structured workout plans to maintain momentum.

# 3. Focus on Wellness, Not Weight Loss: 
* Instead of emphasizing weight loss, Bellabeat should promote the unique and comprehensive Wellness Score, which differentiates it from competitors. Data shows that weight tracking is one of the least-used features, suggesting that users prefer a more holistic approach to health.

* The Wellness Score gives users a snapshot of their overall physical and mental health, offering an uplifting and motivational alternative to weight-tracking. This feature can help users stay consistent with their health goals by providing daily insights into their progress.

* Additionally, focusing on aspects like meditation, hydration, and menstrual cycle tracking reflects Bellabeat’s positive, well-rounded values, making the brand more appealing to current fitness consumers while also attracting a broader, less fitness-focused audience by offering a non-intimidating entry into health and wellness.

# Summary: 
Bellabeat should continue to market its holistic and comprehensive health monitoring services, highlighting how their products (the Ivy and Leaf) provide all the fitness tracking features that Fitbit users love, while also offering additional tools like the Wellness Score. This feature helps users monitor other key aspects of their health—hydration, stress, and the menstrual cycle—in an upbeat and stylish way, setting Bellabeat apart from competitors.
